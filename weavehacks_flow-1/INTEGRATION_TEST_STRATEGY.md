## Testing Architecture

### 1. Unit Testing
Each agent and utility module has its own test file:
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_voice_recognition_agent.py  # âœ… 23 tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_voice_recognition_integration.py  # âœ… New comprehensive tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_video_monitoring_agent.py  # âœ… New video tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_agents.py  # Existing agent tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_chemistry_calculations.py  # Existing chemistry tests
â””â”€â”€ test_integration_full.py  # To be created
```

### 2. Integration Testing Levels

#### Level 1: Component Integration
- Voice Recognition + Data Collection
- Video Monitoring + Safety Alerts
- Audio Diagnostics + Error Recovery

#### Level 2: Workflow Integration
- Complete experiment workflow with voice commands
- Overnight monitoring with automated alerts
- Multi-modal input handling (voice + video)

#### Level 3: System Integration
- Full system test with all agents active
- Performance under load
- Failover and recovery scenarios

## Test Execution Strategy

### Continuous Integration
```bash
# Run all unit tests
cd weavehacks_flow-1
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test suites
python3 -m pytest tests/test_voice_recognition_agent.py -v
python3 -m pytest tests/test_video_monitoring_agent.py -v

# Run integration tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_voice_recognition_integration.py -v
```

### Performance Testing
- Voice recognition latency: < 2 seconds for 5-second audio
- Video processing: 30 FPS real-time analysis
- Memory usage: < 500MB for standard operation

### Stress Testing
- Continuous 24-hour monitoring simulation
- Multiple concurrent voice inputs
- High-frequency sensor data processing

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
1. Voice Recognition Agent
   - Whisper model integration
   - Audio device diagnostics
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. Video Monitoring Agent (Stub)
   - Basic camera operations
   - Motion detection
   - Color change detection
   - Liquid level detection
   - Recording capabilities

3. Error Handling System
   - Centralized error management
   - Recovery strategies
   - Logging and monitoring

### ðŸš§ In Progress

2. Real-time streaming integration
3. Advanced ML-based detection

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
1. WebSocket integration for real-time updates
2. Cloud storage for recordings
3. Advanced analytics dashboard

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Mock External Dependencies
- Use mocks for hardware (cameras, microphones)
- Mock external APIs (OpenAI, Google)
- Simulate sensor data

### 2. Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for consistent test data
- Create realistic audio/video samples
- Maintain test database snapshots

### 3. Error Scenarios
- Device not available
- Network failures
- Permission denied
- Resource exhaustion

## Stability Improvements

### Audio System
- Automatic device selection fallback
- Graceful degradation without audio
- Comprehensive diagnostics tool
- Clear error messages and recovery steps

### Video System
- Camera availability checking
- Frame drop handling
- Automatic resolution adjustment
- Thread-safe operations

### Integration Points
- Proper error propagation between agents
- State synchronization
- Event-driven architecture
- Resource cleanup
