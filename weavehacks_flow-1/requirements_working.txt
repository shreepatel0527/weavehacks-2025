# Working requirements for WeaveHacks Flow
# This avoids dependency resolution hell by:
# 1. Excluding crewai and its langchain dependencies
# 2. Making whisper optional
# 3. Making wandb/weave optional
# 4. Using specific versions that work together

# Core dependencies (absolutely required)
pydantic==1.10.14
numpy==1.24.4
requests==2.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.1

# Data and visualization (needed for UI and chemistry calculations)
pandas==1.5.3
matplotlib==3.7.5
scipy==1.10.1
plotly==5.20.0

# UI (needed for integrated_app.py)
streamlit==1.32.2

# Audio support (needed but lightweight)
sounddevice==0.4.6
soundfile==0.12.1

# Testing
pytest==8.0.2

# Computer vision (can comment out if camera not available)
opencv-python==4.8.1.78

# Backend API (only if running backend server)
fastapi==0.111.0
uvicorn==0.29.0

# IMPORTANT: The following are NOT included to avoid dependency hell:
# 
# crewai - The code has a compatibility layer that works without it
# openai-whisper - Falls back to text input if not available  
# wandb/weave - Optional logging, code works without them
#
# If you absolutely need these, install them separately AFTER the core deps:
# pip install --user --no-deps crewai==0.1.40
# pip install --user --no-deps wandb==0.16.6 weave==0.50.0
